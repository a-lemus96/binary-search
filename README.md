# Logarithmic Occurence Counter and Binary Search Trees 

This repository contains an implementation of an algorithm for computing the number of occurrences of a particular key value within a sorted array whose elements may be repeated. The complexity of the algorithm is logarithmic in the array size and does not depend on the number of repeated elements.

In addition, this repository includes a non-recursive implementation of the binary search algorithm and a brief analysis of interesting properties for balanced binary search trees (BSTs).
